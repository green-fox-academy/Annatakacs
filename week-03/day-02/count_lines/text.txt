An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
A C++ exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running,
such as an attempt to divide by zero.
Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.
C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.&
