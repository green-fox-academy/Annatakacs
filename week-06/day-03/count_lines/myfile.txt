Tropical Depression Nineteen-E was a weak tropical cyclone that caused flooding in northwestern Mexico and the United
States during the 2018 Pacific hurricane season. By September 7, 2018, the storm had entered the northeastern Pacific
Ocean, after crossing Central America. Despite disorganization and its close proximity to land, the meandering
disturbance developed into a tropical depression in the Gulf of California on September 19, with peak maximum sustained
winds reported as 35 mph (55 km/h). Although the storm quickly deteriorated after landfall, thirteen people were killed
in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Sonora, and recorded agricultural losses exceeded US$40 million. Overall, the storm affected
eleven Mexican states, with torrential rainfall and flooding in Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, and Sonora. Remnant
moisture from Nineteen-E led to severe flooding in the U.S. states of Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, with
damage estimates totalling about $250 million.
